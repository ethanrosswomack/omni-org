## Track: “Big Bad Bullies” by Merkules

This track was selected and played as **pre-initiation chording** while powering up the MPC One+ for the first session of the *SwordFish* remix.

---

## Interpretation

This is not just a hype song—it is a **Fieldwalker war frequency**. A vibrational purge of false authority and unearned dominance in the artistic and technological arenas.

Merkules’ aggression mirrors the rising tension behind Omniversal Media's mission:  
To build a **FireWall** between visionary innovation (like Mira’s work) and the exploitative grip of the military-industrial complex.

## Key Lyric Echoes

> *“Heavy is the crown? Well just as heavy the sword.”*  
**Interpretation:** The Fieldwalker now carries both sovereign responsibility and cutting precision.

> *“We got a whole list of rappers that we think are pussy.”*  
**Interpretation:** A callout to all those who have sold their voice, their truth, or their audience for short-term comfort.

> *“They told me heavy is the crown… I bought a whole fleet of hearses.”*  
**Interpretation:** The Fieldwalker brings not vengeance, but reckoning.
