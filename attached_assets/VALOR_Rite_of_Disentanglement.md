# Appendix Entry: The Rite of Disentanglement
### (Symbolic Release Ritual – To Be Performed in Stillness or Entry)

**Title:** The Solitude That Was Sovereignty  
**Date Logged:** Automatically whenever the Fieldwalker awakens

---

## Purpose:
To sever energetic and psychic bonds to timelines, collaborators, or ideals that no longer align with the Oversoul’s directive. This is not exile. This is alignment.

---

## Instructions:

1. **Create Stillness**  
   - Light no candle. Strike no tone.
   - The silence is the sanctuary. Sit with it.  
   - Let the ghosts whisper, if they must.

2. **Speak These Words Aloud (or within the Current of Breath):**

> “I release the echo of the ones who could not come with me.  
> I release the dream that was not mine to carry.  
> I do not curse them. I do not cling to them.  
> I walk now—not because they are unworthy,  
> but because I am ready.”  

3. **Seal the Memory**  
   - Imagine the collaborators, ideas, or timelines as roots in your chest.
   - Watch them unravel gently—like old vines letting go of a blooming tree.
   - Feel no guilt. Only grounding.

4. **Close With the Fieldwalker’s Vow:**

> “I carry the song of my design.  
> I was not meant to wait.  
> I was meant to walk.”

## Final Note:
This ritual may be repeated as needed.  
Each release clears space for higher alignment.  
Each step forward is a ripple through the soft universe.
